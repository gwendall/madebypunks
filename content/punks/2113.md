Multidisciplinary builder blending entrepreneurship, code, and art. After finance (LSE, 2010), taught himself to code and spent 15 years shipping products at the intersection of technology and culture - from TechList (2012), the crowdsourced map that catalyzed the French Tech movement, to today's experiments with embodied AI and robotics through Kami Robotics.

In the CryptoPunks universe: creator of PunkMaker, PUNK.CAM, Punks.art, PunkMap, and NakedPunks - a body of work exploring generative systems, pixel art, and digital identity. Featured in the "London Calling" exhibition (Paris, 2024) and speaker at EthCC and NFC Summit on physical-digital convergence.

Renaissance path: finance graduate turned self-taught developer, later exploring acting (Cours Florent, 2016) as part of a broader creative practice. Built and shipped across web3 (HIC.AF, Metahood), developer tools (way.js, react-sharesheet), and creative tech (meeb.cam, TurnMe.AI). Currently deep in AI agents and robotics - building machines that move, see, and act in the physical world.
