2048 Robots to assist and compliment the CryptoPunk universe.

## The Concept

With RoboPunks, Sean Bonner stated: "I was determined to make something that felt like a contribution to the ecosystem, not just an extractive play on momentary attention. I wanted to make something that felt like it fit in that world, and also that people could enjoy even if they didn’t know about CryptoPunks."

## Inspirations

- **Famous Robots** - Characters from film and TV
- **Monsters** - A few hidden kaiju in the collection just like aliens
- **CryptoPunks** - The original 24×24 pixel portraits
