PIV's oil painting series brings CryptoPunks into the physical world through abstract modernist interpretations. The punks, colors, and isolated traits become the palette for exploring classical art traditions through a blockchain-native lens.

## The Practice

PIV bridges digital and traditional art worlds, treating CryptoPunks as subjects worthy of classical artistic treatment. Large-scale canvases (up to 120x120cm) deconstruct punk attributes into abstract compositions on canvas and wood.

## Notable Works

- **Six Crops** - Fragmented punk portraits
- **Trait Layered Painting** - Deconstructed attribute studies
- **Earring** - Isolated trait as fine art subject
- **Alien Eye** - Abstract exploration of rare attributes
- **Wrapped CryptoPunk** - Physical interpretation of wrapped tokens
- **Still Life with Punk Attributes** - Classical still life with digital objects

Part of PIV's broader practice that includes the Punkism digital series and on-chain NFT collections.
