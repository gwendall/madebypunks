Punks.art is Gwendall's personal laboratory for exploring the CryptoPunks universe through generative art, interactive tools, and visual studies. A creative playground where pixel art experiments come to life.

## Projects & Tools

### Developer Tools

- **API** - A REST service providing access to all 10,000 CryptoPunks, individual traits, and custom combinations. Supports JSON, PNG, SVG, ASCII, and ANSI rendering with customizable backgrounds, gradients, and sizing. Powers PunkMaker.xyz and is free to use.

- **PunkMaker** - The original studio for remixing CryptoPunks. Customize characters with all 87 original traits, adjust colors, apply presets, and export your creations.

### Interactive Experiences

- **PUNK.CAM** - Augmented reality experience that lets you become a punk. Real-time face tracking overlays pixel-perfect punk faces on yours for photos and videos.

- **Punks Wall** - Interactive infinite grid for exploring the entire 10,000-piece collection. Seamless navigation through the complete CryptoPunks archive.

- **Twins** - Discovery tool that identifies punks sharing similar appearances with only minor trait differences. Find your punk's visual siblings.

### Visual Studies

- **Diptychs** - Curated punk pairs examining rhythm and contrast. A study in visual relationships between characters.

- **Nudes** - Full-body 32x32 pixel renderings with anatomically accurate designs, automatic skin tone matching, and gender-specific details. "Unbothered, moisturized, happy."

- **OnlyPunks** - Narrative scenes featuring accessories and pixel drama. Punks placed in storytelling contexts with added visual elements.

### Generative Art

- **Rain** - Matrix-style generative visual with digital precipitation. Animated, retro-computing aesthetics meet punk imagery.

- **Marketplace** - Market analysis tools with playful data visualization. Explore CryptoPunks trading activity through creative charts and metrics.

Gwendall's ongoing exploration of the 24x24 pixel art that started it all.
