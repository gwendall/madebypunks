On January 4th 2023, CryptoNovo got scammed and lost most of his NFTs, including his iconic CryptoPunk #3706.

This initiative coordinates different efforts to help Novo recover the punk back, including the NovoPixels collection made of 576 tokens (one for each pixel of punk #3706). Each token is worth 0.14 ETH, totaling 80 ETH if fully minted - the price to get #3706 back.

No royalties, 100% of proceeds go to a recovery wallet for buying Novo's punk back. A reminder to stay safe out here - today it's Novo, tomorrow it could be you.
